***BYI!:***

- I AM VERY BLUNT AND TEND TO BE RUDE WHEN I AM UPSET, this does not mean you;ve done anything, and this DOESNT MEAN IM TAKING IT OUT ON YOU, it is difficult to control how i type or talk in my moments, i too have my own issues.
- My mood bounces everywhere, AND SO DO MY TOPICS; if im changing topics to quickly or something i said isnt making sense TELL ME, again im NOT a mind reader; if you dont tell me thats on you, not me.
- Going for everything on this BE HONEST WITH ME, if i am doing things you dont like or make you uncomfortable PLEASE TELL ME i don't intend to make people uncomfortable
- PLEASE NEVER GET MAD AT ME OVER THESE THINGS AS IT IS HARD TO READ PEOPLE OVER A SCREEN, I ALSO HAVE MY OWN ISSUES THAT AFFECT THE WAY I BEHAVE OR ACT, THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE THIS IS A WARNING.
- Minors below the age of 13 are on thin ice! I will only allow being friends and nothing MORE!
- People above the age of 19+ are also on thin ice, I don't like your sketchy intentions unless you're only being friends w me/or talking to me normally ^^
- I dont ask for much, so please respect me and my boundaries; and i will do the same.
- DO NOT FLIRT WITH ME WITH OUT ASKING PLEASE !!! This makes me extremely uncomfortable and it disgusts me if age is not told before hand.
- I CAN HANDLE CONFLICT BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN I ENJOY IT!!! Do NOT set me in the middle of fights or drama, i want to avoid that as much as i possibly can.
- I AM A SYSTEM !! PLEASEEE if you are unaware who is fronting please ask!! ( most of the time it is known by our pony or discord status.)
- I TEND TO GO SILENT OR NON VERBAL AT TIMES, do not take this as an offense to YOU as i have a life behind a screen.
- Do not vent to me unless you're a friend/close friend please, and if so pleasse ask !
